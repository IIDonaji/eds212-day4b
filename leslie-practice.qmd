## Interactive Session 4A
### Matrices 

```{r}
# Make a sequence of values from 1 to 10
my_values <- seq(from =1, to = 10, by =1)

# Look at values (always!)
my_values
```
```{r}
# conver to matrix
my_matrix <- matrix(data = my_values,
                    nrow = 2,
                    ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE) #FALSE will switch
my_matrix
```
## Matrix Math
```{r}
4 * my_matrix
```
```{r}
my_values2 <- seq(from = 21, to = 30) # by defaults will step by 1 even not adding by =
my_matrix2 <- matrix(my_values2, nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
my_matrix2
```
```{r}
my_matrix - my_matrix2
```
## Matrix multipicaltion 
```{r}
cats <- matrix(data = c(0, 4, 3, 1), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
dogs <- matrix(data = c(6, -3, 0, 2), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)

cats
dogs

```

```{r}
# matrix multiplication
cats %*% dogs
```
## Leslie Matrix example
Create a project matrix
```{r}
# create matrix
insect_leslie <- matrix(c(0,0,600,0.2,0,0,0,0.08,0),
                        nrow = 3, ncol = 3,
                        byrow = TRUE)
insect_leslie
```
Specify initial conditions 
```{r}
# insect life stage population size (year 0)
insect_y0 <- c(12000, 700, 500)

```

Find the population for each lifestage at year 1
```{r}
insect_y1 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y0
insect_y1
```
Find the population at each life stage at year 2
```{r}
insect_y2 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y1
insect_y3 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y2
insect_y4 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y3
insect_y4
```
